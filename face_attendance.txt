This Python script does the following:

Load the images from a directory
Encode all the images using face_recognition library
Start the webcam to capture frames
Resize and convert the frames
Locate the faces in the frames
Encode the faces in the frames
Compare the encodings with the known encodings
If there is a match, mark the attendance of the recognized person in an Attendance.csv file
To run this script, you need to have a folder named 'ImagesAttendance' in the same directory where this script is located.
This folder should contain the images of the people for attendance, and the image file should be named with 
the name of the person.
